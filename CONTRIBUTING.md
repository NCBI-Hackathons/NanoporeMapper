# How to contribute

Thank you very much for your interest in helping us with STREAMclean! We're always happy to see new faces here.

We accept [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) via the [GitHub interface](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/STREAMclean/pull/new/master)!  

Our `master` branch is protected and you can't directly push code to it. To submit a pull request you should create a new branch and submit a pull request from this one.

In your local copy (or fork) of STREAMclean you can start a new branch in the following way:

`git checkout -b my_new_branch`

From there you can push to GitHub as you'd usually do using `git push`, which will end up in the new branch. You can then submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on GitHub to our master branch. Generally pull requests should be reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before being merged.

## What to work on
Our [issues page](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/STREAMclean/issues) has several open issues that could use some love. If you feel that you can contribute to any of these we'd appreciate it a lot.

## Request enhancements

Open a new issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/STREAMclean/issues), or send a mail to snpr-development@googlegroups.com so we can get the ball rolling!
